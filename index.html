                <p>
                    Ian turned TEN this year and started 4th Grade. He celebrated this decade milestone with a Zoom birthday party and a socially-distanced parade of friends and family.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A year filled with all sorts of remote learning, quarantining and isolation has given Ian plenty of time to perfect his video game skills. You'll find him splatting octolings in Splatoon 2, building elaborate homes in Minecraft or exploring Hyrule in Zelda: Breath of the Wild.

                <h1>You Found Ainsley!</h1>
                <p>
                    Ainsley turned eight this year and started 2nd Grade. By the time her birthday rolled around in September, we were very practiced at staying indoors and away from others. She had a birthday date with Dad (the zoo and a movie) and a birthday date with Mom (XXXX).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ainsley spent her year devouring physical and audiobooks, practicing accents from around the world and writing, drawing, coloring and painting. At the end of the year, she put those artistic skills to good use: she designed and sold a coloring book, earning $XXX for charity.
