                <h1>You Found Ian!</h1>
                <p>
                    Ian turned ten this year and started 4th Grade. He celebrated this decade milestone with a Zoom birthday party and a socially-distanced parade of friends and family.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A year filled with all sorts of remote learning, quarantining and isolation has given Ian plenty of time to perfect his video game skills. You'll find him splatting octolings in Splatoon 2, building elaborate homes in Minecraft or exploring Hyrule in Zelda: Breath of the Wild.

            <div slot="found">
                <h1>You Found Ainsley!</h1>
                <p>
                    Ainsley turned eight this year and started 2nd Grade. By the time her birthday rolled around in September, we were very practiced at staying indoors and away from others. She had a birthday date with Dad (the zoo and a movie) and a birthday date with Mom (XXXX).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ainsley spent her year devouring physical and audiobooks, practicing accents from around the world and writing, drawing, coloring and painting. At the end of the year, she put those artistic skills to good use: she designed and sold a coloring book, earning $XXX for charity.

            <div slot="found">
                <h1>You Found Remy!</h1>
                <p>
                    Remy turned one this year. Due to COVID, he was able to spend a large portion of the year at home instead of at daycare. He loved it, and we all got the chance to watch him develop into a curious, intelligent and mischievious toddler.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Remy enjoyed a lot of life changes this year. He's on the move, learning to walk, run, jump and dance. He enjoys music and has a very specific playlist. He seems to be part fish, preferring to spend his time in the bath, in the pool or in the sink.
