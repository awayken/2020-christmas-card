                    <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/eBnAnxTgog59xbmZ9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ian turned ten</a> this year and <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/vWJmh6oVLXe5ydUg7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">started 4th Grade</a>. He remains an enigma: wry but sincere, antagonistic yet sweet. His teacher appreciates his sarcastic attitude, and thank goodness for that. He celebrated this decade milestone with a Zoom birthday party and <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/vWJmh6oVLXe5ydUg7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a socially-distanced parade of friends and family</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A year filled with all sorts of remote learning, quarantining and isolation has given Ian plenty of time to perfect his video game skills. You'll find him splatting octolings in Splatoon 2, building elaborate homes in Minecraft or exploring Hyrule in Zelda: Breath of the Wild.

                <p>
                    <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/nRvJEAd4By35FvKTA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ainsley turned eight</a> this year and <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/vWJmh6oVLXe5ydUg7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">started 2nd Grade</a>. By the time her birthday rolled around in September, we were very practiced at staying indoors and away from others. She requested separate birthday dates with Mom and Dad. She visited the zoo, <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/BwfgodLwFX2Yaq4U8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">got hair extensions</a>, saw a movie and enjoyed a mani/pedi.

                    Ainsley spent her year devouring physical and audiobooks, practicing accents from around the world and enjoyed lots of creative outlets: writing, drawing, coloring and painting. At the end of the year, she put those artistic skills to good use. <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/Ygup6E8w2mUnacSf9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">She designed and sold a coloring book</a>, earning $250 for charity.

                <h1>You Found Remy!</h1>
                <p>
                    <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/GUS4czrjHiF5Arcf9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Remy turned one</a> this year. Due to COVID-19, he was able to spend a large portion of the year at home instead of at daycare. <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/HQLfWsaFRvVFnbPb7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">He loved it</a>, and we all got the chance to watch him develop into a curious, intelligent and mischievious toddler.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Remy enjoyed a lot of life changes this year. He's on the move, <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/XLMNqBnDMXjPYysh7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learning to crawl, walk</a>, run, jump and dance. <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/vTfvhKRzeeBRgYAw8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">He enjoys music</a> and has <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5O30izu9MAxmrJ6ddmLCSw?si=6GgfJA4YSd-H7o14PtNNhA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a very specific playlist</a>. He seems to be part fish, preferring to spend his time <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/xhGeWns2gMpAEq1V7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the bath</a>, at the fridge water dispenser or in the sink.
